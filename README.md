# AnalysisOfViableParameterRegions

- solver.py contains code for a glocal sampling of viable parameter regions. We ran solver.py on four biological models. These models are repressilator, ac-dc circuit and D flip-flop in a master-slave configuration.

- acdc.py, repressilator.py, and dFlipFlop.py contain definitions of biological models and code for their deterministic and stochastic simulations.

- analysisACDC.py, analysisFlipFlop.py, and analysisRepressilator.py contain code for plotting simulations and performing analyses.  

- files in folders contain results obtained with solver.py
